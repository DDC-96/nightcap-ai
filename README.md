# üç∏ Nightcap

**Nightcap** is a sleek, modern cocktail web app designed to deliver a moody and elevated drink discovery experience. Built with a fullstack architecture using **Next.js** and **FastAPI**, it also allows users to generate AI-powered cocktail recommendations and explore handcrafted recipes leveraging the OPENAI API (In progress).

---

### üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TailwindCSS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.11
- **Containerization**: Docker (multi-stage builds), Docker networks
- **APIs**: AI cocktail generator endpoint, RESTful cocktail data
- **AWS**: AWS Infra is going to be used to host this along with some Github Actions for CI/CD deploymets.

### üîç Features

- **Cocktail Generator** ‚Äì Input your intrest, get a unique cocktail suggestion.
- **Recipe Pages** ‚Äì Explore curated recipes with images and descriptions.
- **Dark Mode First** ‚Äì Built with a moody aesthetic and toggle-ready theme support
- **Dockerized** ‚Äì Fully containerized frontend and backend for reproducible builds.
- **Rewrite Proxy** ‚Äì Frontend seamlessly proxies API calls to backend container.

### üß™ Current State

- Frontend and backend are containerized and communicate via Docker network
- Image assets are handled via the Next.js `public/` directory
- API routes proxy to FastAPI for seamless local dev and container use
- Project structured with future AWS infrastructure support in mind
- Github Actions will be implemented next
- Replacing .env secrets handling with Doppler API credential handling or AWS KMS fetching.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- For local Docker builds, make sure both containers share the same Docker network (e,g. docker run -d --name nightcap-frontend --network `networkname` -p 3000:3000 nightcap-frontend) do the same for the backend container that would be running on port `8000:8000`.
- Rewrites are configured to route `/api/*` to the backend service in production builds
- Build Github Actions workflow for Docker, integrate Doppler Secrets
